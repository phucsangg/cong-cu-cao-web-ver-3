# History of Modifications

## Added Files
- [.node-version](file:///d:/Work/cong-cu-cao-web-ver-2/.node-version): Specified Node.js version `22.17.0` for Netlify deployments to fulfill requirements of `@sparticuz/chromium`.

## Modified Files
- [netlify/functions/scrape.js](file:///d:/Work/cong-cu-cao-web-ver-2/netlify/functions/scrape.js):
  - Isolated `@sparticuz/chromium` to only load when in production Serverless (AWS Lambda) environments, skipping it in local development (`netlify dev`) to prevent executable spawning errors.
  - Added try-catch blocks to request interception functions to prevent requests from hanging.
  - Wrapped `page.evaluate` in a try-catch block to fall back to static HTML scraping via Cheerio if the browser's execution context is destroyed or page is navigating.
  - Replaced the top-level CommonJS `require('puppeteer-core')` with an asynchronous dynamic `import('puppeteer-core')` inside the handler function to avoid `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` when running on AWS Lambda.
  - Implemented DOM tree-distance proximity matching (using custom `getCheerioDistance` and `getDOMDistance` helpers) in both Cheerio and Puppeteer paths to associate each price node with its mathematically closest title/link. This resolves cross-talk and duplication issues when crawing pages containing multiple product sections/grids.
  - Added `isLayoutContainer` helper to prevent parent traversal from going up into layout-level containers (like grids, rows, lists, body, main). This limits parent traversal to single-product cards, preventing runaway page-wide `querySelectorAll` searches and resolving the HTTP 502 function timeout.
  - Increased Cheerio fast-path threshold from 3 to 8. This avoids returning recommended/featured items prematurely on category pages that render main products dynamically.
  - Merged remote `phucsang/main` changes containing general `<script>` tag selection logic for `productSaleSetup` extraction.
- [netlify.toml](file:///d:/Work/cong-cu-cao-web-ver-2/netlify.toml):
  - Added `functions = "netlify/functions"` under `[build]` to ensure the Netlify builder and CLI locate and deploy the serverless functions folder, resolving 404 errors on `/api/*` endpoints.
- [public/index.html](file:///d:/Work/cong-cu-cao-web-ver-2/public/index.html):
  - Merged new UI changes from remote branch. Added SKU (Mã sản phẩm) and Series parsing, display in UI table/grid, searching capabilities, and CSV/Shopify export mapping.
  - Changed the early-exit condition to break the sequential page loop if a page yields 0 new items (`newCount === 0`) instead of `products.length === 0`. This stops useless repeated crawing of identical pages.
  - Cleaned up redundant early stop checks in frontend logic after merging remote `phucsang/main` changes.
  - Redesigned and updated `extractSku` to use case-sensitive matching, list of excluded common words (e.g. gas, vùng, nấu, etc.), and immediate validation bypass for Hafele dotted codes, resolving inaccurate and false-positive extraction.
  - Added URL input mode switcher (Single manual URL vs .txt file upload containing a list of newline-separated URLs) to support bulk category crawling in a single execution.
  - Replaced collapsible accordion with an always-visible, beautifully styled glass advanced settings panel to improve UX.
  - Added a Jaccard token-based similarity fuzzy matching algorithm (with a 60% threshold, excluding catalog stop words) to match and group products that do not have an extracted SKU/Series.
  - Added a Price Comparison View ('So sánh' tab mode) that clusters products by SKU or Jaccard similarity and highlights the lowest ('Rẻ nhất') and highest ('Cao nhất') prices in real-time.
- [test-fetch.mjs](file:///d:/Work/cong-cu-cao-web-ver-2/test-fetch.mjs):
  - Updated SKU/Series extraction testing logic to align with the frontend improvements.

## Bugs Found
1. **Fallback Path Bypass on Local Dev (Windows)**: `@sparticuz/chromium` was imported and initialized on local Windows machines because the module is installed. `chromium.executablePath()` returned a folder/path that exists, so `fs.promises.access` succeeded, but running `puppeteer.launch` failed because it's not a valid Windows executable. This bypassed the local Chrome/Edge fallback search.
2. **Hanging Network Requests**: No error handling inside Puppeteer's `page.on('request')` hook, which caused requests to hang on redirect or when already handled, leading to page goto timeouts.
3. **Execution Context Destroyed Error**: If page navigation is delayed or times out, calling `page.evaluate` threw `Execution context was destroyed`, causing the function to crash instead of parsing the loaded HTML.
4. **Node Version Engine Mismatch on Serverless**: `@sparticuz/chromium` v149.0.0 requires Node.js `>= 22.17.0` or `>= 24.0.0`. If Netlify environment uses default Node (e.g. 18 or 20), it would fail to compile or execute.
5. **Missing Functions Directory Config (404 Error)**: The `functions` property was missing in the `[build]` block of `netlify.toml`. This caused Netlify CLI / builder to skip deploying the serverless functions directory, resulting in HTTP 404 when querying `/api/*`.
6. **ERR_REQUIRE_ESM on AWS Lambda for puppeteer-core**: `puppeteer-core` version 25.1.0 is a pure ES Module. Calling `require('puppeteer-core')` at the top level of a CommonJS file (`scrape.js`) throws `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` when executed in the production AWS Lambda environment, crashing the serverless endpoint and returning a 502 Bad Gateway.
7. **Cross-talk & Duplicate Filtering in Multi-Section Pages**: In pages containing multiple product sections or grids, crawing got stuck repeatedly crawing only 1 section (getting duplicate entries of the first section's items). This happened because the scraper traversed up to 5 levels to find product titles and links, but when it reached a higher-level container (such as a row, swiper wrapper, or grid) containing multiple products, it called `querySelectorAll` or `.find()` globally on it, returning the first product's title for *all* products in that container. The de-duplication stage then discarded all other products as duplicates.
8. **Premature Cheerio Fast-Path Success on Dynamic Category Pages**: When crawing dynamic category pages (e.g. `bep-tu.html`), the raw HTML contains no actual products but has a few featured/recommended products statically rendered. The Cheerio fast-path scraped these 4-6 featured products. Since this is >= 3 (the original threshold), the scraper returned them immediately and skipped Puppeteer. On page 2, 3, etc., the scraper fetched the same static HTML, returning the same featured products which were discarded as duplicates, resulting in 0 new products.
9. **Infinite Page Fetch Loop on Duplicate Pages**: If a category page ignores page parameters (e.g. returning page 1's products on page 2) or has only 1 page, the scraper got stuck in an infinite page-crawing loop because the break condition only checked if `products.length === 0`, which is false since it keeps returning the same products.
10. **Runaway Page-Wide DOM Distance Calculation & Function Timeout (HTTP 502)**: When crawing pages where certain price nodes did not have valid titles close by, parent traversal went up to the root element (`<body>` or `<html>`). At this level, it performed `parent.querySelectorAll` which returned thousands of elements, and calculated tree-distance for each of them. This O(N^2) complexity froze the browser thread during `page.evaluate`, causing the Netlify Function to hang and time out, resulting in HTTP 502 Bad Gateway after 40 seconds.
11. **Inaccurate and False-Positive SKU and Series Extraction**: The model extraction regex used case-insensitive matching (`/i`) which caused normal lowercase words like "gas 3" in "Bếp gas 3 vùng nấu" to be incorrectly matched as a product SKU. It also struggled with complex hyphenated model numbers (like `HS20-SSN2R90M` which was split into two separate codes) and failed to extract purely numeric Hafele article codes (`536.01.695`) due to requiring at least one letter.

## Fixes Applied
1. Prevented `@sparticuz/chromium` from loading when not on AWS Lambda or when `NETLIFY_DEV` is true.
2. Added try-catch and `isInterceptResolutionHandled()` checks to Puppeteer request interception.
3. Wrapped `page.evaluate` in a try-catch that falls back to grabbing static `page.content()` and parsing it via Cheerio.
4. Added `.node-version` file to lock Node.js version on Netlify to `22.17.0`.
5. Explicitly defined `functions = "netlify/functions"` under `[build]` in `netlify.toml`.
6. Loaded `puppeteer-core` dynamically inside the handler via `await import('puppeteer-core')` to support ES module loading in a CommonJS function.
7. **DOM Distance Proximity Matching**: Replaced the first-match logic in parent traversal with tree-distance calculation (`getCheerioDistance` in Cheerio, `getDOMDistance` in Puppeteer). Now, the scraper evaluates all candidate titles/links under the parent and pairs each price node with its mathematically closest title/link in the DOM tree.
8. **Increased Fast-Path Threshold**: Increased the fast-path Cheerio threshold from 3 to 8. Category pages with fewer than 8 static products will fallback to Puppeteer to execute JS, scroll, and capture all products.
9. **New Product Exit Condition**: Changed the break condition in sequential crawing to stop if a page yields 0 new/unique products (`newCount === 0`) instead of `products.length === 0`.
10. **Layout Container Early Break**: Added `isLayoutContainer` check during parent traversal. It immediately breaks the loop when hitting multi-product layout elements (like rows, grids, lists, sections, main, or page body), keeping searches local to single-product cards and avoiding runaway calculations.
11. **Refined SKU and Series Extraction**: Updated `extractSku` in `public/index.html` to use a strict case-sensitive regex for uppercase brand prefixes and model numbers. Introduced a comprehensive validator (`isValidSku` logic) to filter out common Vietnamese kitchen catalog words and general measurement units. Added an immediate bypass check for Hafele-style dotted codes, and improved hyphenated/slashed model group support.
